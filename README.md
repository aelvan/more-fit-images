# More Fit Images plugin for Craft CMS 3.4

Fixes a bug in Craft 3.4 where thumbs in the Control Panel were cropped instead of fitted, see
[https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/5515](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/5515) and
[https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/5518](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/5518).

**This is only a stop-gap solution until Pixel & Tonic fixes the bug, which is
scheduled for Craft 3.5.**
